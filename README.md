#A Perl of Bid Euchre

This is double-deck euchre in Perl.  A later UI goal for this specific project is to add a runtime option to give the computers bad attitudes (a.k.a. they give you the wisdom of `fortune -o` when they lose a game or get euchred and puzzle you with the scatological limericks).

This is part of the [Euchre.US](http://www.euchre.us) [project](https://www.github.com/EuchreUS/Euchre-US), so visit there for the specific rules implemented and requirements for the project.
